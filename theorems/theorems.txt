Dilworths Theorem

    definition - chain - a totally ordered set. usually refers to totally ordered subset of a partial order
    definition - antichain - set of elements which no two of which are comparable to each other
    definition - chain decomposition - parition of totally ordered set into disjoint chains

    statement  - for a finite partially ordered set the largest antichain equals smallest chain decomposition
                    largest antichain     -> means largest set size
                    smallest chain decomp -> means smallest number of chains for all possible decompositions

    notes      - antichain is a level in the hasse diagram. the largest antichain is the max width of the hasse diagram
